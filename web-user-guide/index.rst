Web Introduction
================

The Mica Web Application is the administration web interface of the Mica
server. It is NOT the end-user web portal and therefore firewall policies can
(or should) be applied to restrict access to administrators or content editors.

See the :doc:`../documents` presentation page for a detailed description of the
type of documents that can be edited through this web interface.

The following manuals are available:

* :doc:`documents-management`: add, edit, publish documents and associated files
* :doc:`data-access-request`: approve/reject data access requests
* :doc:`admin/index`: configure server settings and data
  access requests form

Requirements
------------

This web interface is a javascript application requiring a modern web browser.
There is no requirement regarding the operating system.
