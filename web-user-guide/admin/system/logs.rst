Logs Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Summary*
*********

This is to select what should appear in the log file typically located at ``/var/log/mica2``. For each namespace, there are various level you can
choose from such as: ``trace`` , ``debug`` , ``info`` , ``warn`` , and ``error``. Each level is typically more informative than the next one.
