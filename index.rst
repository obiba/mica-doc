OBiBa Mica Documentation
=========================

Targeted at individual studies and study consortia, `OBiBa <http://obiba.org/>`_ software stack (Opal, Mica etc.) provides a software solution for epidemiological data management, analysis and publication. While `Opal <http://www.obiba.org/pages/products/opal/>`_, the core data warehouse application, provides all the necessary tools to import, transform and describe data, `Mica <http://www.obiba.org/pages/products/mica/>`_ provides everything needed to build personalized web data portals and publish content of research activities of both studies and consortia. Based on the content defined in Mica, `Drupal <https://www.drupal.org/>`_ is the preferred platform to build your personalized web portal.
Mica is to be used with `Agate <http://www.obiba.org/pages/products/agate/>`_, the `OBiBa <http://obiba.org/>`_'s central authentication server which centralizes user related services such as profile management, and a notification system using emails.
